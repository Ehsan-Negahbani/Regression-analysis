# Simple-Linear-Regression-Tutorial
What is simple linear regression? 

In this tutorial we will learn what is simple linear regression.
I have included intution behind the model, theoretical backgrounds and Python examples showing how to implement and use this model.

I have used these refrences to produce this tutorial:
1. Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera
2. Machine Learning Course using Python by IBM on Coursera
3. An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/
4. End-to-end Machine Learning: Polynomial Regression course on Udemy created by Brandon Rohrer https://www.udemy.com/end-to-end-machine-learning-polynomial-regression/
